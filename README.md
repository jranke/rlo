# rlo

The R package `rlo` uses the UNO API of libreoffice to write to existing
libreoffice writer documents.

This is useful for useRs that appreciate the functionality of the libreoffice
writer for writing documents, but would like to be able to insert results from
R calculations.

However, it is also possible to start, populate and save libreoffice documents
without even touching the GUI:

```r
library(rlo)
rlo_start(file = "test.odt", overwrite = TRUE)

rlo_heading("Example heading", 1)
table_data = data.frame(
  City = c("MÃ¼nchen", "Berlin"),
  "Elevation\n[m]" = c(520, 34),
  check.names = FALSE)

rlo_table(table_data, "Two major cities in Germany")

rlo_quit()
```

## Prerequisites

`rlo` depends on the R package `PythonInR` and the python bindings of
libreoffice called the Python-UNO bridge.

### PythonInR

The `PythonInR` package can be installed from CRAN or from the
[https://bitbucket.org/Floooo/pythoninr/](bitbucket repo), where you can also
find instructions for installation and setup.

### Python-UNO bridge

On Debian and possibly on derived distributions, installing `Python UNO` can be
as easy as

```bash
apt install python-uno
```

I have tried to use this package on Windows 7, with Libreoffice 5, with limited
success. There is some code showing what I did in the windows branch of this
repository.

## Documentation

An online version of the package documentation can be found on [github.io](https://jranke.github.io/rlo).
